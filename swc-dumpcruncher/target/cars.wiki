The '''Mercedes-Benz W105''' is an automobile produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] from 1956 to 1959 and marketed as the '''Mercedes-Benz Typ 219'''. Part of the "[[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|Ponton]]" family, it featured a 2.2 L [[inline-6|inline 6-cylinder]] engine. 

==History==
The ponton body shape had been introduced in 1953 by the [[Mercedes-Benz W120|W120 chassis 180]]. In the following year, Mercedes-Benz introduced the 6-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz W180|220a]] which was visually similar to the 180, but with 70&nbsp;mm added to the front wings to accommodate two extra cylinders and 100&nbsp;mm added to the rear doors to provide some extra legroom for the rear passengers. This model ran until 1956 when the 219 and the [[Mercedes-Benz W180|220S]] were introduced.

==Model identification==
The 219 from the a-pillar forward was identical to the long-nosed 220a, including the single-carburettor 2.2 L 6-cylinder engine. However, from the a-pillar back, it used the shorter body of the W120/W121 180/190 models. This can be identified by the one-piece windows in the rear doors, as opposed to the 220a and 220S having separate quarter windows.

Inside, the 219 used the simpler instrumentation of the small car, along with bakelite trim instead of woodgrain.

The '''Guyson E12''' was a run of two cars commissioned by hill-climb champion Jim Thomson and built by [[William Towns]].<ref name=icon>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?townsguysonf.htm Guyson E12] AROnline Retrieved: 27 March 2010</ref>
It was a rebodied series III [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type Jaguar]], the first of which came about as a result of Thomson crashing his Jaguar in 1972. The first model was completed for Thomson in 1974 with Towns subsequently converting his own E-Type.

The '''third generation [[Ford Focus]]''' (also known as '''MK III''') debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2010|2010 North American International Auto Show]] as a 2012 model. The cars shown were a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback, also debuting a new 2.0L [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] I4 engine. A 5-door estate (wagon) was previewed at the Geneva auto show a month later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33304 |title=Exciting New Next-Generation Ford Focus Gears Up For Launch &#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

This generation of Focus would be the first [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicle designed under the tenure of CEO [[Alan Mulally]] and his "One Ford" plan, which aimed to leverage Ford's global resources into creating more competitive vehicles that could be sold globally in each segment with minimal changes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ford Focus chief quits|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-focus-chief-quits|accessdate=30 June 2015|work=[[Autocar]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]}}</ref>

The "One Ford" plan would reunite the North American and global Focus line. The [[Ford Focus (second generation, North America)|previous North American version]] was thus discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe on May 2, 2011, both having started production near the end of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |title=Detroit auto show: 2012 Ford Focus, most significant by AW Editors' Choice Awards |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100121171755/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |archivedate = January 21, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31755 |title=DYNAMIC NEXT-GENERATION FORD FOCUS DEBUTS |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]]}}</ref> Production in Asia, Africa, and South America followed later.

Ford debuted the all-electric Ford Focus Electric at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2011 to compete with the [[Nissan Leaf]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and announced the [[hot hatch]] ST model at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in September 2010.

The Ford Focus was the best-selling car in the world for 2012.<ref>[http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=619afc64-1886-4110-a3f0-a1df03b47726 James Tate, Ford Focus is best-selling model worldwide in 2012, editorial.autos.msn.com] Retrieved on 11 April 2013</ref>

== Design ==
The design built on Ford's [[Kinetic Design]]. At the front, lights have an different shape while a trapezoidal grille has introduced triangular features. At the rear, hatchback tail lights were positioned lower similar to [[Ford Fiesta]]. The interior has been changed from the second generation in the NA and International versions. Ford wanted to make the Focus more upmarket so it offers two types of central consoles, the basic is with smaller engines and the premium is available more powerful engines.

This generation of Focus incorporated a redesigned cabin changed materials and new infotainment system. Following the industry trend towards decontenting and in keeping with the sedan's downmarket "economy car" image vs. the "premium" hatchback, the earlier sedan's space-saving gas strut trunk hinges are replaced with cheaper, intrusive goose neck hinges. The Focus also has Ford's patented capless fuel tank, which doesn't require a cap to prevent [[siphon]]ing.

== Production ==
The Focus is being promoted as a global car,<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaign Tactics: Ford Focus Global Launch|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2011/02/25/Ford-Focus-Global-Launch.aspx|work=Brand Channel|accessdate=July 10, 2012|date=February 25, 2011}}</ref> built in several different factories around the world, with changes to engine line-ups and trim levels to suit regional markets and regulations.

Various trim levels are available, with SE and Titanium on both sedan and hatchback, and a budget S level for the sedan only.

=== Engine lineup in North America ===
The Focus was launched with only one engine option, a 2.0-litre [[Mazda L engine#2.0 L .28LF-DE.2C LF-VE.2C LF-VD.29|Duratec 20]] [[gasoline direct injection|direct injected]], [[Variable Cam Timing#Ti-VCT|Ti-VCT]] [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]], producing {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

For the 2015 refresh, the EcoBoost 1.0 litre three-cylinder began to be offered in North America as an extra-cost option.

=== Running Changes ===
Color choices were restricted during summer 2011, due to supply issues caused by the 2011 Japanese earthquake/tsunami. When black and dark blue returned they were replaced by different shades, although the phaseout of Kona Blue in favor of Sonic Blue had been planned.
In January 2012, Ford announced that the formerly automatic-only Titanium model would be offered with a manual transmission. In March 2012, Ford revised the ordering guide for the Titanium models to also have a [[MyFord Touch]] delete option, replacing it with the non-touch version of MyFord. Although MyFord Touch is an $995 option on SEL models and the PowerShift automatic a $1095 option on S and SE, no discount is applied to either manual or non-Touch Titanium models.
2013 model year changes for non-STs are; SE models gain standard SYNC and alloy wheels, the SEL trim is discontinued in favor of an "SE Appearance package" that includes most of the SEL features but with standard trim choices limited to black leather, while Titanium models also pick up standard leather upholstery. All now come standard with the 5-speed manual leaving the SFE pack as the last remaining automatic-only Focus (apart from the direct-drive electric), and color choices are rearranged.
<br style="clear:both" />

=== Reliability issues ===
Along with the [[Ford Fiesta]], the Focus equipped with the [[Ford PowerShift transmission]] has received much criticism due to transmission shuddering, including several [[lemon law]] claims. Ford claims that the transmission, a [[semi-automatic transmission]], is designed to improve [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and has issued several software upgrades for the transmission. To date, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] has not required Ford to issue a [[Product recall|recall]], nor has Ford issued a recall voluntarily. Focus models equipped with the conventional [[manual transmission]] have not been affected by the reliability issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wtae.com/investigations/investigation-finds-hundreds-of-complaints-about-ford-transmissions/24333878|title=Investigation finds hundreds of complaints about Ford transmissions|first=Paul|last=Van Osdol|work=[[WTAE-TV]]|publisher=[[Hearst Television]]|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

The UK range is available in hatchback and estate (wagon) in a large number of trim variants including. Most other European countries, including the Republic of Ireland, also include the four-door saloon, unlike Britain, as previous generation sales did not sell as well in comparison with the hatchback and estate.

== Facelift (Post-2014) ==
The Ford Focus facelift (Mk 3.5) was shown at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, and features a raft of changes made to both the exterior, interior and engine line up.

Changes include:
*[[Lane Keeping Aid]] + [[Lane Keeping Alert]]
*[[Driver Alert]]
*[[Hill Start Assist]]
*[[Blind Spot Information System]]
*[[Adaptive Cruise Control]] (ACC) with [[Distance Indication]]/[[Distance Alert]]
*[[Pre-Collision Assist]]
*[[Forward Alert]]
*[[Active Braking]]
*[[Active City Stop]]
*[[Bi-Xenon]] Headlamps with [[Adaptive Lighting]]
*[[Auto High Beam]]
*[[Traffic Sign Recognition]]
*[[Torque Vectoring Control]]
*[[Auto Start-Stop]]
*[[Active Grille Shutter]]
*[[Tyre Pressure Monitoring System]]

Revisions made to the body were thinner and sharper headlights, a new trapezoidal grille, giving the front more sporting intent than the previous model. The new front end is similar to that of the [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Mondeo]] as well as the facelifted [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] that was introduced in 2013, inspired by the 2011 [[Ford Evos]] concept as well as various [[Aston Martin]] vehicles. (Ford owns an 8% interest in Aston Martin.)  The [[Ford C-Max|recently facelifted Ford C-Max and Grand C-Max]], [[Ford S-Max|the all-new S-Max]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]], have also incorporated the new family face. On Titanium and Titanium X the grille is chrome, and on other versions it is black mesh. The ST features a Black honeycomb grille.The front fog-lights were also changed. At the rear on the hatchback, the rear lights were changed, so that they appear sharper, and less clumsy. The estate and saloon, (saloon is not available in Britain), also had subtle revisions to their rears too.

Inside, the multitude of buttons on the dashboard have been removed, and replaced by an all-new eight inch touchscreen. The quality of plastics have improved, and the steering wheel is a new three-spoke. Trim levels in the UK consist of Studio, Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium, Titanium X and ST. Trim levels in Europe are similar to the pre-facelift model including Ambiente, Trend, Trend +, Titanium and ST. The new 1.5 TDCi Duratorq diesel (95 and 120&nbsp;hp) and 1.5 Ecoboost (150 and 180&nbsp;hp) has been added to the line-up. The 2.0 TDCi Duratorq diesel has been updated to produce 150 and 185&nbsp;hp.

The new third-generation RS model has been confirmed, with Ford stating that the new RS will now go on sale in 2016. The pricing is rumoured to be below £30,000 and it will have 350 hp. It was revealed in the flesh at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, and featured at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

Mechanical improvements to the facelifted [[Ford Focus]] are chassis revisions to all versions, to make the car more planted on the road, and the steering is also sharper than the pre-facelift model, while also offering greater feedback for greater driving pleasure and fun, which has been the trademark of the Focus since it launched back in 1998.

== Focus ST ==
[[File:Ford Focus - Mondial de l'Automobile de Paris 2012 - 002.jpg|thumb|right|2012–2014 Ford Focus ST]]

Beginning Summer 2012 (UK)/late 2012 in the US, Ford offered a new performance-oriented [[hot hatch]] Focus ST, as first revealed at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]] and then at the 2011 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] when more details were announced, including the availability of an estate(wagon) version for European markets, and the possibility of a [[sports sedan]] version for North American markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Ford-Focus-ST-2012-at-the-Frankfurt-motor-show/|title=Ford Focus ST (2012) at the Frankfurt motor show|publisher=Car Magazine |date=201-09-12 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>

The ST features a new, more aggressive exterior design, including a redesigned front bumper with larger air intakes and grille, larger rear wing, wider side sills, center exit exhaust, and alloy wheels. Inside, the car receives a trio of additional gauges mounted in the dashboard, faux-carbon fiber trim, and sport seats with body colored inserts and stitching. The car will be offered three trim options: ST1, ST2 and ST3; the  same three options that were available with the MkII ST.

Differences between the US and European models besides the lack of the wagon model outside Europe and Federally-required amber side reflectors are limited to paint and trim: Euro ST1s get all-cloth Recaro seats while U.S.-spec ST1s use the same seats as the 2012 SE Sport Package; Red seat accents on the Recaro seats are not available on American ST2s; Euro ST3s feature a leather Recaro rear seat setup; The rear headrests are different in each market; Red is the only exterior color included in the base price in Europe while yellow is the only extra-cost color in the U.S.; The optional MyFord Touch system that is fitted to ST2/ST3 models in the U.S. is not offered in Europe; The North American ST utilizes a full-size spare tire while the Euro ST features a mini spare or fix-a-flat setup, depending on what audio system is fitted; The Euro ST offers further options (some grouped in option packages) compared to the North American models including: red brake calipers (standard on all ST trim levels in U.S.), pop-out door guards, heated windshield, lane departure system, and active speed limiter; Headlight washers are fitted to the Euro ST3; Only the ST3 model in the United States features the handbrake, armrest, and cup holder design from the Focus Titanium, while all Euro and Canadian Focus STs have that setup; The Euro Focus ST features a height-adjustable front passenger seat.

The ST will use a {{convert|252|hp|abbr=on}} & {{Convert|366|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} version of the 4-cylinder 2.0L EcoBoost engine, a gain of 25&nbsp;hp above the previous Focus ST which used a larger 2.5L 5-cylinder engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/ford/focus/2012/2012-ford-focus-st-2010-paris-auto-show.html|title=2010 Ford Focus ST – 2010 Paris Auto Show|publisher=Edmunds Insideline |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}</ref> It is resultantly estimated that the ST will reach {{convert|100|km/h}} in 6.5&nbsp;seconds, while its top speed will be {{convert|248|km/h}}. Compared to the previous ST, the new model has the same 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h time and has a 2&nbsp;mph higher top speed. Another significant improvement is weight; the new car is {{convert|30|kg}} lighter than its 5-cylinder powered predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frankfurt2011.fordmedia.eu/indexNonFlashVersion.htm#|title=2012 Ford Focus ST official specifications released|publisher=media.ford.com |date=201-09-12 |accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

The ST did feature in the remake of the film ''[[The Sweeney]]'', coming out in September 2012. Ford gave six ST-badged Focuses to the production team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fordstnation.com/top-stories/49-ford-focus-st-lead-car-sweeney-movie-2012-a.html|title=2012 Ford Focus ST To be lead in Sweeney Movie|publisher=Ford ST Nation |date=November 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref>{{-}}

=== Facelift (Post-2014) ===

For the facelift for the 2015 model year, the ST will continue with the 250&nbsp;bhp 2.0 litre Ecoboost, in the trim levels ST-1, ST-2 and ST-3. It also remains as a 5-door hatchback, and an estate (wagon). For the first time, a 2.0 litre TDCi Duratorq Diesel engine will debut in the ST to rivals the likes of the Volkswagen Golf GTD and the Seat Leon FR. In the ST it produces 182&nbsp;bhp, and 400 NM of torque. Pricing and badging is the same for both petrol and diesel models.

==Overview==
The '''Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt''' is a limited production, factory experimental, [[drag racing|drag race only]] automobile built by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1964.  A total of 100 units were produced; forty-nine four-speed and fifty-one automatic, enough to secure the 1964 [[NHRA]] Super Stock title for Ford.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/hi/427fairlane/ Thunderbolt fansite at Angelfire.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-fairlane/ford-fairlane-history-2.shtml History of the Thunderbolt at Musclecarclub.com]</ref>

Based on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] and named for a factory experimental Fairlane of 1963, the Thunderbolt combined the light weight of Ford's intermediate-sized body introduced in 1962 with a "high rise" {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with dual [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel carburetors intended for use in the much larger [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]].  That engine as used in the Galaxie for [[NASCAR]] racing did well, but the Galaxie was simply too heavy an automobile in stock trim to be drag raced successfully; so-called "lightweight" 427-powered Galaxies were built both for stock car racing as well as drag racing during the 1964 model year, although these cars were not modified to the extent of the Thunderbolt.<ref>http://www.carcraft.com/featuredvehicles/ccrp_0411_1964_ford_galaxie_500/index.html Feature on the 1964 Galaxie lightweight factory race car at Carcraft.com</ref>  As installed in the Thunderbolt, the engine was (like all US cars, due to insurance regulations) conservatively rated at {{Convert|425|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 RPM; estimates placed the actual output was close to {{Convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>http://www.kitcarmag.com/thehistoryof/0411kc_ford_427_cammer/index.html</ref>
<ref>http://www.holmanmoody.com/history.html</ref>
In standard form, the Fairlane was {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter than a Galaxie, rode on a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase and weighed approximately {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}  less.  Installing the [[Ford_FE_engine|Ford FE V8]] in a vehicle intended for an engine no larger than a [[Ford_Windsor_engine|Ford Windsor/Challenger engine]] required major reworking and relocation of the car's front suspension components and the modification and strengthening of the suspension mounting areas.  [[Fiberglass]] doors, hood, front fenders and even the front bumper on the earliest cars along with [[Plexiglas]] side and rear windows aided in weight reduction; the hood with its distinctive raised "teardrop" ram air scoop designed to draw hot air from the engine compartment was pinned in position, eliminating the need for a hood hinges and a latch.  Later cars had aluminum front bumpers in place of the fiberglass unit due to racing regulations.<ref name=hsw/><ref name=r1>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PGYLpmlt5coC&pg=PA130|pages=130–131|title=Ultimate Performance Cars|author=Richard Gunn|publisher=MotorBooks International|year=2006|isbn=0-7603-2571-5}}</ref>

Racing equipment included tubular [[exhaust header]]s, an electric fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical [[leaf spring]]s, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, [[locking differential]], auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Mickey Thompson]] (himself a recipient of one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load.  The claimed [[compression ratio]] was 13.5:1.<ref name=hsw>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1964-ford-fairlane-thunderbolt.htm Article on the 1964 Thunderbolt at Howstuffworks.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z15643/Ford-Thunderbolt.aspx History of the Thunderbolt at Conceptcarz.com]</ref>
 
Other weight-saving measures included the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire.  Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the [[Ford Econoline|Econoline]] van; the carpeting was replaced by a black rubber mat.  The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit.  The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427.  Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high/low 5.75&nbsp;inch (146&nbsp;mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch.  Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics made the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.  

The Thunderbolt was not built on a regular Ford assembly line, but rather in conjunction with Andy Hotton of Dearborn Steel Tubing.  It was there that partially built Fairlane bodies in top-of-the-line "500" exterior trim were combined with the 427 and either a heavy-duty [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] automatic transmission  or a [[Borg-Warner]] four-speed manual transmission.  The first eleven cars were painted in Ford's "Vintage Burgundy" while the remaining eighty-nine cars were painted "Wimbledon White."  The engine code reflected not the 427 on most cars but rather the so-called "K-code" [[tappet|solid lifter]] 289 hi- performance engine..<ref>http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0911_ford_thunderbolt_reunion/index.html Article on the reunion of surviving Thunderbolts at Hotrod.com</ref> 

Given the special nature of the car, Ford riveted a metal plate to the inside of the glovebox door of the Thunderbolt and other race-only models with a disclaimer relating to fit and finish.  The plate read:

::''This vehicle has been built specially as a lightweight competitive car and includes certain fiberglass and aluminium components.  Because of the specialized purpose for which this car has been built and in order to achieve maximum weight reduction, normal quality standards of the Ford Motor Company in terms of exterior panel fit and surface appearance are not met on this vehicle.''

::''This information is included on this vehicle to assure that all customers who purchase this car are aware of the deviation from the regular high appearance quality standards of the Ford Motor Company.'' <ref>[http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0001_1964_ford_thunderbolt/index.html Reprint of January 2000 article in ''Hot Rod'' Magazine describing the disclaimer plate on a Thunderbolt used on a road tour]</ref><ref>[http://www.1964ford.com/lightweight.aspx History of the lightweight 1964 Ford drag cars at 1964ford.com]</ref>

The '''Elfin  Type 100 Mono''' is an [[Australian 1½ Litre Formula]] racing car produced from 1964-1969 by [[Elfin Sports Cars]]. The name "Mono" refers to the fact that it was constructed upon a [[monocoque]] design.

==Development==
[[File:Elfin Mono Type 100.jpg|thumb|left|Elfin Type 100 Mono at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood in [[South Australia]]]]
In 1963, [[Garrie Cooper]] began work on a revolutionary [[monocoque]] design of a car intended to dominate the newly created [[Australian 1½ Litre Formula|Australian 1½ Litre capacity class]]. [[Lotus Cars]] had already built the Formula 1 monocoque under the direction of [[Colin Chapman]] but the idea was still in its infancy so [[Garrie Cooper|Cooper]] had only vague ideas of the design. The [[monocoque]] build removed the need for the traditional [[Superleggera|"Superleggera" tube frame chassis]] and harnessed a very light sheet steel frame to which aluminum panels were riveted for a very stiff structure. The finished structure weighed approximately 80&nbsp;kg less than the [[Superleggera|tube framed]] [[Elfin Catalina]] it replaced. Uniquely, the hollow section of the body was sealed off to serve as the petrol tank. The Elfin Mono eventually made its debut at the August 1964 Melbourne Racing Car show and orders quickly followed.<ref>http://melbourneclassics.com/files/THREE_AUSTRALIAN_GPs.pdf</ref>

'''VIAC''', the '''VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge''', is the challenge conceived by [[VisLab]] as an extreme test of [[Intelligent car|autonomous vehicles]].  It ran from July 20, 2010 to October 28, 2010, involving four [[driverless car|driverless vehicles]] driving with 
virtually no human intervention on an almost {{convert|16000|km|mi}} trip from [[Parma]], [[Italy]] to [[Shanghai]], [[China]].<ref name="VIAC">{{cite web|author=webmaster@ce.unipr.it |url=http://vislab.it/Projects/view/32/VisLab%27s_adventure_on_the_Silk_road |title=VisLab's Adventure on the Silk Road |publisher=Vislab.it |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref><ref name=done>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_CHINA_EU_DRIVERLESS_VEHICLE?SITE=VASTR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Without driver or map, vans go from Italy to China"], Elaine Kurtenbac, AP.COM</ref>
<ref name=cnn>[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/10/27/driverless.car/index.html?iref=allsearch "Driverless van crosses from Europe to Asia"], Jo Ling Kent, CNN.COM</ref>

==Overview==
The [[Expo 2010 Shanghai China|2010 World Expo]]'s theme was “better cities, better life”; therefore issues related to sustainable mobility were central to the Expo and this challenge of reaching Shanghai with driverless vehicles provided a clear demonstration of future vehicles; it is considered one of the main milestones in [[Robotics]].

[[VisLab]], thanks to a  project partially funded by ERC -the [[European Research Council]]- showed that one day it will be possible to move goods between two continents with non-polluting vehicles powered by green energy and with virtually no human intervention. Goods were packed in [[Parma]] and taken to [[Shanghai]] on driverless vehicles for the first time in history.

==The idea==
The aim was to test and stress the current technology in a unique event:  non-polluting and non-oil based [[Driverless car|autonomous vehicles]] in real traffic conditions on an extreme journey between two continents, the final outcome being a huge dataset with a very large variety of situations to be further used to refine the onboard perception system.

==Technical details==
The trip traversed remote areas in Russia, Kazakhstan, and China, for which no map was available; due to the length of the trip it was also impossible to check and test the route in advance. Therefore VisLab defined the following behavior.

The first vehicle drove autonomously in selected sections of the trip, conducting experimental tests on [[sensor|sensing]],  [[decision making software|decision]], and [[Control system|control]] subsystems, and continuously collecting data. Human interventions were needed on a regular basis to define the route and intervene in critical situations.

The second vehicle automatically followed the route defined by the leader vehicle by following it either visually or thanks to GPS waypoints sent by the leader vehicle, therefore requiring no human intervention (100% autonomous). This is regarded as a readily exploitable vehicle, able to move on predefined routes. 

During the trip, demonstrations were scheduled in specific hot spots, showing autonomous vehicles following given routes, negotiating traffic, avoiding obstacles, and stopping when required. The first demonstration was held in [[Rome]] at the EUR district on October 29, 2009, when Rome's Major, [[Gianni Alemanno]], officially presented the VIAC challenge.
The last demonstration was given exactly one year later, on Oct 28, 2010, in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], during a parade at the World Expo, organized by the European Pavilion.

Although the vehicles were electric and had solar panels on the roof, propulsion was not powered by the solar panels but by the original vehicle's batteries which were charged at power outlets or, when no power outlet was available,  by generators. The solar panels powered the autonomous driving system (sensors, processing engines, actuators, radios, GPS,..).<ref name="VIAC_FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://viac.vislab.it/?page_id=155 |title=Challenge FAQ |publisher=Viac.vislab.it |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref>

==Worldwide Milestone and Data Analysis==
The VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge is considered a unique milestone in vehicular robotics, just like the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] in 2005 and the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]] in 2007. The vehicles collected about 50 terabytes of data to be used in the future for further processing off-line.

==Organization and Logistics==
The logistics were managed by Overland Network, which provided 4 RVs (motor homes) and 3 additional trucks as a support. The expedition was therefore formed by 4 autonomous vehicles, 4 RVs, 3 trucks, and occupied about 20 people for three months.  A satellite link broadcast live data and video streaming for the whole duration of the trip (except in China) so that everybody on the Internet was able to witness the progress of the experiment.

There are several ways to charge the battery:
* using 10A 220V-240V household [[mains power]] from a standard electrical outlet in 10–12 hours
* using 16A with a 3&nbsp;kW public charge spot or specifically installed home charging spot in 6–9 hours
* the battery uses a "QuickDrop" system that allows it to be quickly switched for a charged battery at a dedicated battery exchange facility.

The Fluence Z.E. uses a [[synchronous motor|synchronous electric motor]] with rotor coil, weighing {{convert|160|kg|abbr=on}}. Its peak power is {{convert|70|kW|abbr=on}} at 11,000rpm, while maximum torque is {{convert|226|Nm|abbr=on}}.<ref name =GCC0410/><ref name=RenaultZE/>

The Fluences uses a PRND gate selector as well as providing a small amount of creep in 'D' to emulate the behaviour of traditional internal combustion engine equipped [[automatic transmission]] cars.

Better Place customers needed only to drive up to the entrance of a [[Battery swapping|battery switch station]] to start the switch process. The Oscar in-car navigation system uses a WiFi connection to communicate with the station's computers and an RFID tag on the windscreen of the subscriber's car identifies it. The barrier opens and the customer drives up to a mark. The dashboard screen and external monitors then give instructions to select Neutral and turn off the ignition.
The remaining process is fully automated, similar to going through a [[car wash]], so the driver never has to leave the car. In just a few minutes, a robot beneath the car removes the depleted battery and replaces it with a full one. Once complete, instruction is given to restart the car and an exit barrier lifts.<ref name=GCC0611/>

After implementing the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model in Israel and Denmark, Better Place filed for [[bankruptcy]] in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about {{USD|850}} million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi.Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E.s were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark through May 2013.<ref name=NYT052613>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/global/israeli-electric-car-company-files-for-liquidation.html?_r=0|title=Israeli Venture Meant to Serve Electric Cars Is Ending Its Run|author=Isabel Kershner|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref><ref name=JPost052613>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Death-of-Better-Place-Electric-car-co-to-dissolve-314380|title=Death of Better Place: Electric car co. to dissolve |author=Niv Elis|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>

The electric car was scheduled to go on sale to the public from a number of dealers across the country in the fourth quarter of 2012. Better Place explained that delays in the deployments in Israel and Denmark reflected in the Australian roll out, which would take place between 12 to 18 months behind the other markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/205154/renault-fluence-z-e-launch-delayed-due-infrastructure-hold-ups/|title=Renault Fluence Z.E. launch delayed due to infrastructure hold-ups |author=Tim Beissmann |publisher=Car Advice|date=2012-12-13|accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref> However, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in May 2013.<ref name=NYT052613/>

'''Slot.it Challenge''' is a UK [[slot racing]] championship sponsored by Slot.it and Pendle Slot Racing and held between April and November since 2006.

==Format==
The format of the championship has never changed since the start in 2006. With the race event always held on a Sunday, the Saturday is used as timed practice for visiting drivers, with home drivers not allowed to practice on the Saturday. The hosting venue also holds a meal at the most popular and closest hotel to the track on the Saturday evening after practice. For racing every driver does a three minute stint on every lane. Then these laps totaled to give an overall position, and these positions used to determine what lane a driver will be on for step-up finals. The winning driver after the step up finals is awarded fifty points, with the second driver taking forty-nine points etc. This was the same for the juniors up until the end of the 2008 season, from then on the juniors winning points were reduced to twenty points with the second junior taking nineteen points etc.

At the end of the season, if a driver has completed all the events then his worst round will be erased, with a driver competing in all but one event keeping all his points.

==Venues==
The starting venue since 2007, Pinewood only held the one event on its "old" track in 2007. Since it got a new 105&nbsp;ft, gloss surfaced track in 2008. This track has always been one of the hardest to master within the racing weekend. The tracks main features are a very short start, a high-speed banked 180 degree corner and a technical and challenging section top section of track. In the first season of racing, the winning pace was completing 24.4 laps within the three minutes. However, in 2010, the winning pace is now up to 28.7 laps within three minutes, giving an average lap time increase of 1.1 seconds over 3 minutes.

In 2002, DARPA announced the first Grand Challenge: "Build a robotic vehicle able to travel unassisted on a predefined path of about 130 miles through the Mojave Desert. The fastest robot to navigate the course in less than 10 hours will take home $1 million." The first competition was scheduled in March 2004.

After learning of the Challenge in 2003, a small group of [[UL Lafayette]] students and professors joined together to see if they could take on the task of designing a completely autonomous vehicle.<ref name="DesertDerby">{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/03/09/darpa.race/index.html|title = Desert derby to find top battlefield bot|accessdate = 2010-04-23|last = |authorlink = | work=CNN | date=2004-03-10}}</ref> "GPS Bot" was engineered as a proof-of-concept, using a small remote controlled car coupled with a micro controller and GPS sensor.

Building on the success of previous challenges, DARPA has launched a new competition, dubbed the "Urban Challenge". The event took place in November 2007, set in Victorville, California.

The Urban Challenge required teams "to build a robotic vehicle that can operate in urban traffic, finding its own path while also following traffic rules".

Each team was provided a GPS map of an urban cityscape, simulating military supply missions in an urban setting. Traveling among manned and robotic vehicle traffic, the team vehicles traveled through required points in the mock city. Teams were required to complete the 60-mile course safely in less than six hours.<ref name="CajunBotHistory2007">{{cite web|url = http://cajunbot.com/history/urban-challenge-2007|title = Urban Challenge 2007 (CajunBot History)|accessdate = 2010-04-18|last = |authorlink = |year = }}</ref>

The '''Avanti''' is an American performance [[sports coupe]] based on the [[Studebaker Avanti]] and produced by a succession of five different ownership arrangements. After the closure of [[Studebaker]]'s [[South Bend]] factory on December 20, 1963, cars with the name Avanti were initially produced from left-over Studebaker components and later from [[General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] chassis and engines. These are not replica cars, for they were made by '''Avanti Motor Company'''. 

==Altman and Newman==
[[File:1976 Avanti II (Rahmi M. Koç Müzesi).jpg|thumb|1976 Avanti II]]
After Studebaker ended production at South Bend, the "Avanti" model name, tooling, Studebaker truck production rights and parts and plant space were bought by local Studebaker dealers, Nate and Arnold Altman and Leo Newman, who incorporated as Avanti Motor Corporation and hand-built a small number of cars.<ref>[[#Langworth|Langworth]], p. 278</ref> Leo Newman ran the Studebaker truck parts division which enabled the company to be profitable at its outset. According to Stu Chapman, Studebaker Director of Advertising & Public Relations 1964-1966, in his book 'My Father The Car: Memoirs Of My Life With Studebaker', there was talk with Studebaker of reintroducing the Avanti to Studebaker showrooms in 1965/66, along with ambitious plans for rebadging an [[Isuzu Bellett]] as an entry level Studebaker, and combining with Canadian Motor Industries. This would have taken control and production away from the South Bend board who at the time was determined to discontinue auto production no matter that Studebaker was the only car company in history to discontinue a make that was still profitable.

The Altman brothers introduced a slightly modified version of the car in 1965 under the brand name "Avanti II".<ref>[[#Langworth|Langworth]], p. 257</ref> which initially had a 327-in³ (5.4 L) [[Chevrolet Corvette]] engine.

The Avanti Motor Company was re-purchased by [[Michael Eugene Kelly]]. He moved the production to Ohio in 1987.
 
The company had the  second-generation Avanti's styling originated by Tom Kellogg, the youngest member of the original Avanti Studebaker design team, at first called the AVX in the mid 90's. Tom Kellogg was fatally injured in a car accident in California on August 14, 2003.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Douglas |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/business/thomas-w-kellogg-71-a-studebaker-avanti-designer.html?pagewanted=al|title=Thomas W.

==Cafaro years==
[[File:1991 Avanti II sedan.jpg|thumb|1991 Avanti four-door sedan]]
Real estate man John J. Cafaro purchased the rights to Avanti Motor Company in 1988. With the help of the State of Ohio, he moved all Avanti production from South Bend - its birthplace - to the [[Rust Belt]] area of [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. In 1988 and 1989 Avanti made two-door coupes and a convertible. The 1988 Avanti were called the "Silver Year" models, marking 25 years since the Avanti's introduction. The 1989 Avanti were given a ground effects packaging.

Cafaro was noted for making the four door Avanti in 1990, an idea from the original designer, Raymond Loewy.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Cafaro concentrated on the four door to the detriment of the original coupe, the company's primary vehicle. Only 90 were made at the Youngstown plant. In 1991 Cafaro went back to building the convertible before the plant was closed later that year.

==Michael E. Kelly returns==
M. E. Kelly moved Avanti operations from Ohio to Georgia in 1999 and produced redesigned Avanti automobiles in [[Villa Rica, Georgia]] from 2000 to 2005, before moving to [[Cancun, Mexico]]. 
From 2004, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] chassis and engines were used. In October 2005 an internet report said "Avanti Motors" had "recently announced a new relationship with Ford Motor Company and was planning a big comeback".<ref>Spinelli M, [http://jalopnik.com/cars/news/game-on-avanti-motors-hopes-to-survive-and-thrive-in-2006-130353.php Game On: Avanti Motors Hopes to Survive and Thrive in 2006] at jalopnik.com, October 11, 2005</ref>  An internet report in 2006 said Kelly had sold the company in 1988 and repurchased it in 1999 from Cafaro of Ohio; and that the company had established a new factory and showroom in [[Villa Rica]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In early 2006, Kelly moved Avanti production to a new plant in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], but the company floundered after M. E. Kelly was arrested in December 2006 on fraud counts related to an alleged  [[ponzi scheme]] in the United States.

The last Avanti to date rolled off the line in Cancun, Mexico in March of 2006. All the Mustang-based Avantis used V-8 engines, with the option of a Ford V-6. Only one 2006 Avanti was built with a Ford V-6 engine.  The factory and showroom were emptied in 2011 and have been sold. Many extremely rare Studebaker and Avanti concepts and racing vehicles that were on the second floor of the building in Cancun have been moved elsewhere and/or sold.<ref>{{cite web

The '''BAR 004''' was the car with which the [[British American Racing]] team competed in the {{F1|2002}} [[Formula One]] season. It was driven by [[Jacques Villeneuve]] and [[Olivier Panis]].

During the season the car was unreliable having a dismal start which saw the team fail to score a single championship point during the first half of the season. Also Olivier Panis failed to finish the first seven races. The team scored their first points when they finished fourth and fifth at the [[2002 British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Eventually the team finished eighth in the Constructors' Championship with 7 points.

The '''Aston Martin RHAM/1''' was a highly modified Aston Martin DBS V8 racing car, developed by [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]], built with the intention of racing at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. After development by Hamilton, RHAM/1 competed in the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans|1977]] and [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans]], finishing 17th overall and 3rd in the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] class in the 1977 race. The car has also held the [[World Land Speed Record]], for towing a caravan, at the speed of 124.91&nbsp;mph.

== Design ==

After completing his apprenticeship with Rolls Royce in [[Derby]], Robin Hamilton set up Robin Hamilton Motors in Tutbry with David Jack. At Robin Hamilton Motors they specialised solely in [[Aston Martin]]s. Hamilton gained large experience with [[Aston Martin]] [[DBS V8]]'s and AM V8's while at the specialist. Hamilton's [[DBS V8]] (DBSV8/10038/RC) was only the second ever production [[Aston Martin V8]] to take to the track. Competing on 6 April 1974, with the first raced V8 being a DBS V8 in 1970 at the [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] Curborough Sprint.

With Hamilton's experience DBSV8/10038/RC was developed and developed and after large modifications to the car over the three years of 1974 to 1977, the car became unrecognisable and the original chassis number of DBSV8/10038/RC, was changed to RHAM/1 (Robin Hamilton Aston Martin #1). Which was the car that would finally fulfil Hamilton's intentions of racing at [[Le Mans]].

Whilst this is not a works car, support was provided by the Aston Martin factory, and indeed lessons learned from the [[Motor Industry Research Association|MIRA]] wind tunnel test sessions were applied to the [[Aston Martin V8|V8 Vantage]] in the form of front air dam and rear spoiler.

== Racing History ==

=== 1974 ===

In 1974, Staffordshire based Aston Martin specialist, [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] began competing a lightly modified 1969 DBS V8 (DBS/10038/RC) in [[Aston Martin Owners Club]] events. The first major alterations that were made to 10038/RC were made to make the car conform to Group 4 regulations and bring the car into line with the then current production AM V8 by fitting the latter's single headlight AM V8 front end.

To make the Le Mans dreams possible the Aston Martin V8 was [[Homologation|homologated]] for racing, which involved registering the car with both the [[Motor Sports Association|RAC MSA]] (now [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]]) and the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]].

=== 1975 ===

Due to the large modifications to the aerodynamics of the car, DBSV8/10038/RC was not usable on the roads. At this stage the car was far quicker than any standard DBS V8, however only shared similar power outputs to the production V8 Vantage.

With [[Le Mans]] the eventual target, the car was further developed to incorporate modified cylinder heads, revised camshafts, side-draft [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] carburettors and a race exhaust system, while the suspension and brakes were also upgraded, with stiffer and shorter springs, larger brakes, wider wheels and racing slick tyres. In this form DBSV8/10038/RC raced in [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] events throughout 1975, competing up until September 1975. The car showed promise, proving to be a match for former [[Le Mans]] cars at the AMOC [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] meeting in July by finishing 3rd. Later that year, the car gained a quartet of dragster-style downdraft Weber carburettors, which were the height of half the [[Windshield|windscreen]] for the 1976 season.

=== 1976 ===

The DBS V8 appeared at the Jaguar Drivers Club meeting in April 1976 as after it had undergone wind tunnel testing at [[Motor Industry Research Association|MIRA]] (through backing from [[Aston Martin]]). The car's power output had not tested on a [[dynamometer]], nor a rolling road, with the only testing being held on straight stretch of {{convert|3|mi|km}} of local public road.

The car only completed half of the events in 1976 due to the preparation for the scheduled [[Le Mans]] appearance. [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] hoped to race at the [[1976 24 Hours of Le Mans|1976 Le Mans race]], even preparing a sponsorship brochure, seeking financial support. With the brochure saying: "''The Aston Martin will run in Group 4, and although it is unlikely to finish 1st overall, stands an excellent chance of winning this Group, which would carry almost as much prestige as winning the race overall.''"<ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 39, 1990</ref> In the personnel list, famous [[Aston Martin]] team manager [[John Wyer]] was listed as project consultant and [[Willie Green (racing driver)|Willie Green]] as second driver, with the third driver to be announced.

Fred Hartley, an interim managing director at Aston Martin in 1976, had promised assistance to Hamilton, via a letter to him. But this financial assistance, nor a sponsor was found and the car did not go to the 1976 Le Mans race but this was probably a good Oman, as according to Hamilton, "''Actually it was just as well, because I don't think we would have been ready for it''." <ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 36, 1990</ref>

In November/December 1976 Hamilton was allowed 2 weeks of testing on the engine test-bed facilities at Aston Martin's Newport Pagnell factory . With liaison from Dave Morgan (experienced with Lola-Astons of the 1960s and later the Aston Martin Nimrod V8's), there was small development with the engine and "''suggestions about carburettors and bell-mouths''."<ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 37, 1990</ref>

Robin Hamilton went back to the Aston Martin Factory for financial backing (£20,000) for the project, suggesting an idea, for production of a powerful 380-{{convert|400|bhp|abbr=on}} limited edition [[Aston Martin V8]]. His idea being to increase the sale price by £1000, this £1000 funding his project. Aston Martin dismissed the idea, even though Hamilton had made drawings of the proposed car. In 1977 [[Aston Martin]] went on to introduce the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]], similar to Hamiltons idea, but only coincidental.

Robin Hamilton got assistance from Mike Loasby, who paid for a wind tunnel test session. In which they made the spoiler and other pieces to make the Vantage. The car saw a 10% reduction in drag and increased downforce bodywork. The car now almost had the same body shape as the Vantage. All efforts were then put into making the 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sponsor would eventually found.

=== 1977 Le Mans 24 Hour ===

[[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] again released a sponsorship brochure for 1977, but again failed to get any large sponsorship backing. But Hamilton did gain a small sponsorship deal from SAS in London, a company who specialised in riot and security equipment. Hamilton received £25,000, which covered most of his costs for [[Le Mans]].

The V8 engine of the car, had now been fitted with Nimonic steel valves, special forged [[Cosworth]] pistons and a redesigned sump. The engine would now produce {{convert|520|bhp|abbr=on}} at 6,750 rpm and 381&nbsp;bhp at the wheels. Plus over 400&nbsp;ft·lbf of torque at 5,250 rpm with [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 50 IDA downdraught carburettors. The car by this stage was now a [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] car rather than a [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], which would mean it would have to race against the [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Porsche]]s. Another [[wind tunnel]] test showed that the car would have dangerous amounts of lift on the [[Mulsanne Straight]], so another change had to be made, and a rear tail spoiler needed to be fitted. The wind tunnel test also showed that the [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], (now moved to the back to change the weight bias), would gain then 10&nbsp;mph more in top speed, but it would cause the engine to run too hot, so it had to be moved back to its original location. Four oil coolers also ensured that the engine temperature never exceeded 110&nbsp;°C.

The car also had other modifications made to it, with a redesign of the front bulkhead and mostly drilled box section included in the chassis modifications. RHAM/1 also had roller bearing drive shafts and peg-drive centre lock hubs for the one piece custom made [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] [[Alloy wheel|magnesium wheels]]. The wheels measured 19" in diameter, 15" wide at the rear, and 13" wide at the front and had special, custom made [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop tyres]] for them. The wheels themselves needed to be bigger than 16" to go over the twin [[Disc brake#Calipers|caliper]], 12½" Lockheed, ventilated [[disc brake]]s, with no servo assistance. All of which was needed to stop the 30 [[Centum weight|cwt]] [[Aston Martin]]. The alternator was switched to run off the gearbox (which itself had a closer ratio 5th gear) instead of the engine crankshaft. The clutch was now uprated to a triple plate. The suspension was almost standard, with standard rubber bushes but with slight geometry changes. Nylon mountings were also used for a reduced width Dion tube. The [[roll cage]] was a [[NASCAR]] (instead of [[FIA]]) specification cage, which was bolted to the chassis. This alone weighed 50&nbsp;kg.

The car by then became known as RHAM/1 (its chassis number, Robin Hamilton Aston Martin #1) as it was unrecognisable from the original car. RHAM/1 made its debut at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/chassis/archive/RHAM__001.html|title=Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1|publisher=Racing Sports Cars}}</ref> a pre event to the Le Mans race, on 15 May 1977. By this time Hamilton had gained some financial input from several [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] members, whose names appeared on the rear wing for the race. At the Six Hour race, Hamilton drove alongside fellow AMOC member [[David Preece (racing driver)|David Preece]]. In practice Preece spun off, but not a lot of damage was caused to the car. RHAM/1 qualified on the eight row, in 1 minute 43.39 seconds. During the race, Le Mans gearing ratios and a rev limiter of 6,000 rpm meant the car lost over 100&nbsp;bhp. At a pit stop, heat soak from the in board rear brakes caused the differential oil seal to fail and 55 minutes were lost in the stop. Due to the regulations saying that they could not change the unit, they had to repair it. In order to save more complications, and to finish the race, the car raced on at a much slower pace. Hamilton and Preece did finish, but they failed to reach the final standings due to insufficient laps completed.

After the race, Hamilton had to modify the cooling of the rear brakes, otherwise the car would never last the 24-hour period.

RHAM/1 competed in its first 24 Hour event when it raced at the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans|1977 Le Mans 24 hour]] race.<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> With drivers David Preece, [[Mike Salmon (racing driver)|Mike Salmon]] (a Le Mans veteran, Salmon had driven the last Aston to race at the Sarthe, Peter Sutcliffe's [[Aston Martin DP214]], in 1964.) and Robin Hamilton himself. A request was made to move to the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] category (from the competitive Group 5, where opposition was deemed less strong. This request was granted by the organisers.

The first practice was a wet session, and all drivers came accustomed to the wet conditions. With RHAM/1 putting in respectable lap times, being assisted by good tyre grip with the aid of huge 1516&nbsp;kg weight of the car (heaviest by 5½ [[Centum weight|cwt]]). The fastest time would have put them in the middle of the grid. In the next practice session the car ran with both [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] ducts open, which aided cooling down to 85&nbsp;°C, but gave the effect which was likened to losing a cylinder on the Mulsanne Straight, due to the increased drag. In the last hours of qualifying, Hamilton had to put in quick laps in the dark, in order to make the cut for the race. Hamilton put in a best time of 4 minutes 31.8 seconds, With the V8 engine producing 520&nbsp;bhp, RHAM/1 was recorded at 188&nbsp;mph on the Mulsanne Straight during qualifying. Hamiltons time was well inside the 4 minutes 48 seconds maximum time, however this was the slowest in the GTP class. The organisers for the race, then decided to reduce the field to 55 cars, which meant losing the slowest car in each class, which would have meant RHAM/1 would have been dropped. But one of the other GTP class racers had broken the rules and were cut instead, to the relief of Hamilton who only found out 5 hours before the race.

In the race itself, the car started with a lower front spoiler to aid stability, but this lost the car 10&nbsp;mph in top speed. Hamilton drove the opening stint, but came into the pits after 11 minutes with brake vibration, but this was down to the brakes bedding in. Hamilton's stint was followed by Preece and then Salmon, with the Aston picking up 23 places in 2 hours. The Aston's fuel efficiency was good, better than first thought after the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hour race, but this could have been improved, as GTP rules allowed for a 160 litre fuel tank to be used compared to the Aston's installed 120 litre tank to meet Group 5 regulations. But this could not be changed before the race.

At a routine stop at 10.19pm, cracks in the front brake discs were discovered. They were replaced in a pit stop lasting 31 minutes, but a lack of further spares meant that they had to reduce the use of the brakes and therefore use engine braking as much as possible for the remaining 17 hours and 41 minutes. Even so lap times remained constant. The only other serious problem encountered was a split differential oil tank that needed regular patching and topping up resulting in one 27 minute pit stop. A few more problems had to be deal with before the end of the race, with a 2 minute stop having to be made to reset the lights on the car. Also the gear lever had to be replaced after Salmon broke it off and threw it out of the window during one of his stints. A marshal collected the gear knob and returned it to the garage, running all the way from his post.

Running steadily to the flag, the Aston Martin crossed the finish line after 2,210.78 miles (261 laps) of racing with Robin Hamilton, who had driven longest of the three drivers, at the wheel. RHAM/1 finished in 17th place overall (from 55 starters) and 3rd in class (GTP category), ironically, if it had stayed in Group 5 it would have finished 2nd in class. Pit stops totalled 3 hours and fuel consumption worked out at 5.75 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]]. With RHAM/1 using a maximum engine speed of 6,400 rpm, averaging 92.12&nbsp;mph (including stops) or 104.70&nbsp;mph (excluding stops). The fastest lap in the car was by Hamilton, recording 4 minutes 34.2 seconds (average speed of 112.25&nbsp;mph). 18 of the 24 hours were driven with cracked front brake discs, the car was later given the name of 'Muncher' due to the rate that the car got through brake discs.

Hamilton achieved a lifelong ambition by driving an Aston Martin across the Le Mans finishing line and also confounded the pundits who claimed that the heavyweight [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS V8]] was totally unsuitable for racing.

=== 1978 ===

For 1978, RHAM/1 was modified even more, now with and output of {{convert|800|bhp|abbr=on}} assisted by twin [[Garrett AiResearch]] turbos. But, fuel consumption dropped to 2.5 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]] (for the 1977 race, the average was 5.75 mpg) so the entry to [[Le Mans]] was withdrawn two weeks prior the race.<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/>

=== 1979 Le Mans 24 Hour ===

RHAM/1 next appeared at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> in May 1979, considerably lightened and re-modeled with a lower roof line, steeply raked windscreen, huge front air dam and dropped bonnet line. While beneath the bonnet was a twin-turbocharged version of the Aston V8 engine with fuel injection in place of the [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburettors]], reducing boost pressure to give maximum power output of {{convert|650|bhp|abbr=on}} in race specification. But this reduced fuel consumption to around 4 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]]. The brakes were enlarged again, to 13" all round and water cooling was developed to help cool them (to be used at [[Le Mans]]). 350&nbsp;lb in weight was also removed, in non Le Mans trim (no extra lights or equipment).

For the race at Silverstone Hamilton was joined by [[David Preece (racing driver)|David Preece]] and [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]], but Hamilton would not race, only working in the pits. After a De Dion tube in the rear suspensison broke whilst Hamilton was driving in the practice. The car qualified 11th out of 25 entrants, with Bell recording 1 minute 37.54 seconds. In the race the car suffered trouble with brake fade and oil breathing problems, the car dropped down to 21st place after 1 hour 30 minutes, but back up to 17th after 3 hours. RHAM/1 finished 13th overall and 6th in class, after being hampered with more problems, of a blown tyre and small engine fire.

Hamilton received sponsorshop for the [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans|1979 Le Mans 24 hour]]<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> from fellow [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] member, Peter Millward through his company Link Systems. The car would again compete in the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] class, weighing 1,546&nbsp;kg it was again the heaviest in the class. Before the race the gearbox and engine were changed due to not being able to select first gear. During the race (with the same set of drivers as Silverstone that year) the V8 proved capable of lapping many seconds quicker than in 1977 (7.32 seconds). But the car suffered more problems, with an ongoing oil leak and then, after it had only competed 2 hours and 45 minutes (21 laps) of the race, a connecting rod broke due to a melted and holed piston.

=== 1980 ===

The car's next race, was at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> in 1980, where RHAM/1 now had a huge rear wing to counterbalance the downforce at the front of the car. Driven by Hamilton and Bell, the car retired early, as after just {{convert|61.5|mi|km}}, when the rear hub failed.

On 14 October 1980 RHAM/1 set a new [[Land speed record|World Land Speed Record]] for towing a caravan on the runway at [[RAF Elvington|Elvington Airfield]], Yorkshire. Robin Hamilton towed an Alpha 14 caravan in the wet to an average speed of 124.91&nbsp;mph, having seen 152&nbsp;mph on the speedometer exiting the timed quarter mile. The speed beat the previous record of 108&nbsp;mph.

=== 1981 ===
[[Image:1977AstonMartinAMV8.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aston Martin RHAM/1 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009]]
With his first hand experience at [[Le Mans]], [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] went on to develop the [[Nimrod Racing Automobiles|Aston Martin Nimrod]] [[Group C]] racing car in the early 1980s.

=== 1984 ===

RHAM/1 was put up for sale by [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] in 1984 when he closed his business and was bought by Chris Crawford.

=== 2005 ===

In 2005 RHAM/1 was for sale with Nicholas Mee's [[Aston Martin]] Car Company.

=== 2006 ===

RHAM/1 was on sale at [[Bonhams|Bonhams']] [[Aston Martin]] auction held on 13 May 2006 at Works Service, Newport Pagnell

== DBSV8/10071/R ==

[[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] built a second [[Le Mans]] styled [[Aston Martin V8|DBS V8]] car based on the look of RHAM/1 as it was in 1978. The car was assembled for Peter Griggs who wanted a replica of the car. The car, with chassis number DBSV8/10071/R featured a fibre glass front end and Piper prepared V8 engine, but the car had no [[turbocharger]]. Fuel injection was replaced by 48 IDA down-draught [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburettors]].

The car had some success with Griggs, winning a race at the 1981 [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] [[Brands Hatch]] meeting, even though the car was quite heavy. In 1982 the car finished 2nd at Brands Hatch and 4th at an Intermarque race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].

Richard Williams bought the car in 1987 with intentions of upgrading the car with an experimental 6.3 litre V8 engine and racing it in the Intermarque events. However the disassembled car was sold to Marsh Plant Holdings where it was reassembled.

The '''Daihatsu Tanto Exe''' is a [[Kei car]] produced by [[Daihatsu]]. The production version made its debut at the 2009 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] and was launched on December 24, 2009 by Daihatsu and April 20, 2010 by Subaru as the '''Subaru Lucra'''. The Tanto Exe was designed to compete with models such as the [[Honda Life]], [[Nissan Moco]] and [[Suzuki Wagon R]]. The Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom, a more sports-oriented version of the Tanto Exe with sports styling, was launched simultaneously. The Daihatsu Tanto Exe and Tanto Exe Custom are both available with a 659cc petrol engine, mated to a 4-speed automatic gearbox on front wheel drive models and [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] on four wheel drive models.

==Subaru Lucra==
[[File:Subaru Lucra.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Subaru Lucra]]
Due to Subaru's strengthened alliance with [[Daihatsu]] and [[Toyota]] (announced April 16, 2008), the company has been able to launch the Lucra to market. Essentially, the Subaru Lucra is a rebadged Daihatsu Tanto Exe, and the Subaru Lucra Custom is a rebadged Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom.

The Daihatsu Tanto Exe and Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom were discontinued on October 2, 2014, due to declining sales caused by the launch of the third-generation Daihatsu Tanto and third-generation Daihatsu Tanto Custom the previous year. The discontinuation left the Subaru Lucra and Subaru Lucra Custom as original Subaru models, even though they were still both being manufactured by Daihatsu. The Subaru Lucra and Subaru Lucra Custom, however, lasted until April 1, 2015, when they were discontinued due to changing tax consumption rules.

The '''Aston Martin DPLM''' (formally known as the '''Gipfast Special''') is a [[sports prototype]] racing car that was built by David Preece and Ken Heywood.  Utilizing an [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine]] tuned by AVJ Developments, the car was designed to participate in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] as well as the [[1980 24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref name="1980 24 Hours of Le Mans entry list">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Le_Mans-1980-06-15e.jpg|title=1980 24 Hours of Le Mans entry list|publisher=Racing Sports Cars}}</ref>  The original Gipfast Special was damaged in its debut race in 1980, while a second chassis was constructed for use in 1982.  Despite the team's intentions, the DPLM only participated in two major races.

After partnering with Robin Hamilton in the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in the unique [[Aston Martin RHAM/1]], Shropshire dentist David Preece set out to create his own car which could compete at Le Mans. During 1979 and 1980 Preece was joined by skilled engineer Ken Heywood to design and build the car which would eventually become known as the Gipfast Special. Other than the engine, most of the project was built in Preece's own garage.  The Gipfast was powered by a mid mounted Aston Martin V8 engine based on the production engine utilized in the [[Aston Martin V8]], similar to that used on the RHAM/1. The engine was tuned by AVJ Developments of Pershore, featuring dry sump lubrication and Cosworth DFV style fuel injection, producing around 480&nbsp;bhp.  The initial chassis, DP/801/H, was completed in early 1980 and entered in the World Championship [[1980 Silverstone 6 Hours|6 Hours  of Silverstone]] in May of that year.  Partnered alongside the returning RHAM/1 under the control of Simon Phillips Racing, the two Aston Martins ran under the title of sponsor Ault & Wiborg.  The Gipfast struggled for speed in its debut, qualifying 29th out of 30 entries and was slower than the RHAM/1.  At the start of the six hour endurance race, the DPLM suffered a suspension failure after only four laps and crashed heavily.  The damage to the car was unable to be repaired in time for Le Mans a month later and the car was abandoned later that year.

===DP/812/H===
After the demise of DP/801/H, Preece and Heywood spent 1981-82 developing a new car, now known as the DPLM (Dave Preece Le Mans).  The second chassis, DP/812/H, was front engined and retained the same AVJ built V8 engine now rumoured to be producing 560&nbsp;bhp.  Debuting in Britain once again at the [[World Sports Car Championship]] 1000 Kilometers at [[Brands Hatch]], the car qualified 28th out of 33 entrants.  The race performance was stunted as the DPLM crashed in the opening laps in treturous weather conditions.  Following the second failure for the DPLM project, the car was retired from competitive use and made successful appearances in [[Aston Martin Owners Club]] and other national events during the rest of the 1980s driven by Preece and later Barrie 'Whizzo' Williams, for the then owner Stewart Bond. The car was purchased from Bond around the year 2000 and was sympathetically restored and recommissioned by its current owners of the Hipwell family, appearing at the AMOC Horsfall meeting at Silverstone in 2003 where the car suffered from fuel feed problems and DNS.
